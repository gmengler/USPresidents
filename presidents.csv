Van Buren was from Kinderhook, NY which was also known as the Old Kinderhook. His support groups came to be known as O.K. Clubs, and the term OK came to mean that someone or something was all right.

Armstrong challenged Lincoln to a wrestling match outside of Denton Offutt’s store, where Lincoln was a clerk, and townspeople gathered to watch and wager on it. Lincoln won.

21   Chester   Alan  Arthur  September 19, 1881   March 4, 1885   Republican  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Chester_Alan_Arthur.jpg/800px-Chester_Alan_Arthur.jpg   Not only was Chester A.

22   Grover    Cleveland   March 4, 1893   March 4, 1897   Democrat  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Grover_Cleveland_-_NARA_-_518139_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Grover_Cleveland_-_NARA_-_518139_%28cropped%29.jpg   When Grover Cleveland’s law partner Oscar Folsom died, Cleveland became the girl’s legal guardian. Frances Folsom was 11 years old at the time. Oddly enough, ten years later, they got married at the White House. She remains the youngest First Lady in the history of the United States, having been just 21 when they married.
23   Benjamin    Harrison  March 4, 1889   March 4, 1893   Republican  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Benjamin_Harrison%2C_head_and_shoulders_bw_photo%2C_1896.jpg/800px-Benjamin_Harrison%2C_head_and_shoulders_bw_photo%2C_1896.jpg   Benjamin Harrison was the sitting president when electricity was first installed in the White House.

While he was president, doctors discovered that Cleveland had a cancerous lesion in his mouth, and they had to remove most of his upper-left jaw as a result. A prosthodontist then installed an artificial jaw made of vulcanized rubber. Cleveland kept the surgery a secret, fearing public concerns over his health, and the entire operation took place on his friend’s yacht.

Because there were no inhalers or special treatments for asthma at the time, he was often sick as a young boy. However, he began to regularly exercise in order to combat the illness and, aside from the occasional asthma attack, he eventually overcame it.
27   William   Howard  Taft  March 4, 1909   March 4, 1913   Republican  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/William_Howard_Taft%2C_head-and-shoulders_portrait%2C_facing_front.tif/lossy-page1-800px-William_Howard_Taft%2C_head-and-shoulders_portrait%2C_facing_front.tif.jpg   After leaving office, William Taft became the only ex-president to serve as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, effectively becoming the only person to serve as the head of two branches of government. In doing so, he swore in both Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover to the presidency. (On an unrelated note, he also lost 150 pounds after leaving office.)
28   Woodrow     Wilson  March 4, 1913   March 4, 1921   Democrat  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/President_Wilson_1919-bw.tif/lossless-page1-800px-President_Wilson_1919-bw.tif.png  To date, he’s the only president to hold a doctorate degree, making him the highest educated president in the history of the United States. He was awarded the degree in Political Science and History from Johns Hopkins University. He also passed the Georgia Bar Exam despite not finishing law school.

In one poker game, he bet the White House china collection and lost it all in one hand.
30   Calvin    Coolidge  August 2, 1923   March 4, 1929   Republican  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Calvin_Coolidge%2C_bw_head_and_shoulders_photo_portrait_seated%2C_1919.jpg/800px-Calvin_Coolidge%2C_bw_head_and_shoulders_photo_portrait_seated%2C_1919.jpg   Calvin Coolidge had a morning ritual in which someone rubbed Vaseline on his head while he ate breakfast in bed.
31   Herbert   Clark   Hoover  March 4, 1929   March 4, 1933   Republican  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/President_Hoover_portrait.tif/lossy-page1-800px-President_Hoover_portrait.tif.jpg   Herbert Hoover moved his family to China before becoming President, and he and his wife learned to speak Mandarin Chinese fluently.

Magazine editor Fulton Oursler was in in attendance, and he hired some mystery writers to flesh out the premise to a novel, which was then adapted into a movie.  FDR received a credit for his contribution to the film.
33   Harry   S   Truman  April 12, 1945   January 20, 1953   Democrat  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Truman_58-766-09.jpg  Before becoming the President of the United States of America, Harry Truman owned a haberdashery business (a men’s outfitter), which went bankrupt in 1921.

Kennedy’s application to study at Harvard was fairly unimpressive by today’s standards. Not only that, but his own father, a Harvard alum, gave him a pretty underwhelming recommendation, saying that young Jack was careless and lacked application.
36   Lyndon  Baines  Johnson   November 22, 1963   January 20, 1969   Democrat  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Lyndon_B._Johnson_Oval_Office_Portrait_%28cropped%29.png/800px-Lyndon_B._Johnson_Oval_Office_Portrait_%28cropped%29.png   President Johnson was famous among White House staffers for having no shame about asking people to follow him into the bathroom to continue conversations as he relieved himself.

Always the opportunist, Nixon had the best poker player in his unit teach him how to play the game. Within only a few months, Nixon had won around $6,000 in poker games, which he used to fund his first congressional campaign.
38   Gerald  Rudolph   Ford  August 9, 1974   January 20, 1977   Republican  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Gerald_Ford_-_NARA_-_530680.tif/lossy-page1-800px-Gerald_Ford_-_NARA_-_530680.tif.jpg   In the 1940’s Gerald Ford did a bit of modeling and even posed on the cover of Cosmopolitan.
